# The Code Academy Parcel Service

## About

We are creating a event driven program that sends out a event listener request. This will wait for and run when those events listeners have triggered.

## Things to do

- vendor
  - Create a in transit emmit in Vendor
  - Create a delivered emit in Vendor
  -  Create an object to send to the /caps server and emit pickup

- After Delivery Emit, exit with `process.exit()`

- driver
  - When pickup is emitted, simulate all driver things
  - Have driver announce for in transit
